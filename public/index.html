            1.- I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.</br>
            2.- I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.</br>
            3.- I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

         <h2>Example creation usage:</h2>
         <p>The following url will take you to a page that shows an array of objects, every object inside the array has a url to an image related to the query, a snippet, a thumbnail url and a url to the source of the image.</p>
         <a href="https://image-search-laloptk.c9users.io/api/imagesearch/loldogs" class="text-warning">https://image-search-laloptk.c9users.io/api/imagesearch/loldogs</a></br>
         <p>The next url is the same as above, only with the "offset parameter added. The 10 after the "=" sign, means you want to skip the first 10 pages, or, what is the same, as every page has 10 results by deault, you want to skip the first 100 query results.</p>
         <a href="https://image-search-laloptk.c9users.io/api/imagesearch/loldogs?offset=10" class="text-warning">https://image-search-laloptk.c9users.io/api/imagesearch/loldogs?offset=10</a></br>
         <p>The following url will take you to a page where you can see an array of objects, where every object has a term that was used as a query (like above) and when that query was performed. It shows the latest 10 queries users searched.</p>
